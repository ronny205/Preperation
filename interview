Practice in your language
When you are doing practice problems, try to always write with the language you’ll be using in your interview.

The couple of weeks leading up to your interview, when you’re doing personal projects and hacking on things for fun, try to use that language as well.

Know thy common operations
Make sure you have at least the following operations down pat:

Initializing and using hash-backed maps (dictionaries) and sets
Performing queue and stack operations (whether using an array, like with Ruby’s pop/shift, or an explicit standard library implementation like Java’s Stack and Linked List-backed Queue classes)
Defining classes with constructors and attributes, static and instance methods, and defining a subclass and interface
Throwing exceptions for (1) invalid input and (2) custom messages
Iterating through arrays and dictionaries (both key and values)—including iterating while maintaining an index (Ruby’s each_with_index, Python’s enumerate)
Casting between strings and integers
Strings: get character at index, get range, concatenate
Initializing 2d arrays
Arithmetic: modulus (remainder), division (if the first operand is an integer, will it round the result to an integer?), rounding (ceiling and floor)
(Bonus) Switch statements
(Bonus) Built-in language sorting. Quickly defining a comparator to sort an array.
(More advanced candidates) The 5 standard bit manipulation operations (L/R shifts, not, or, and, xor)
Know the best practices
Especially if the company you’re applying to has experience with your language, it can be helpful to brush up on the best practices for your language. Sometimes you’ll get trivia questions, or be asked about some language-specific patterns.

If you’re going with Java, for example, and applying to Amazon, where Java is heavily used, consider reading through some of the best practices material.

There are some great books like Effective Java, Secrets of the Javascript Ninja, Effective C++, and The Ruby Programming Language  which cover language-specific best coding practices.
